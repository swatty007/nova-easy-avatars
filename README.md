A small set of additional Avatars types to extend your Nova Panel. Plug & Play.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require swatty007/nova-easy-avatars
```

## Configuration
All fields work without any additional configuration out of the box.
You can however, overwrite their Name & Attribute fields to your liking as on any other Nova field.
Furthermore, you can control the size of your avatars with the **setSize()** && **setFontSize()**(Initials only) method.

The Laravolt based Initials field gives you some extra controls over the look & feel of your Avatar via its configuration file.
For details check out the package's documentation under: https://github.com/laravolt/avatar
> This is helpful, if you want to generate Avatars with a unique color scheme, which matches your application!

## Usage
You can use all available Avatar fields in the same way as Novas build in fields.

``` php
use Swatty007\NovaEasyAvatars\Fields\Initials;

public function fields(Request $request)
    {
        return [
            ...
            Initials::make('Avatar', 'name')
                    ->setSize(350),
            ...
        ]
    
```

The package currently supports the following Avatar Types:
